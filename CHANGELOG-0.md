## 0.68.0

_2018-12-16_

### Breaking Changes

- `optimizeChunks` is renamed to `experimentalOptimizeChunks` to reflect this feature is not production-ready yet ( #2575)

### Features

- Plugins can iterate all module ids via `this.moduleIds` (#2565)
- Plugins can get graph information about a module via `this.getModuleInfo(id)` (#2565)
- Plugins and JS API users get more information about the generated chunks: `dynamicImports`, `facadeModuleId`, `isDynamicEntry`, `name` (#2575)
- Tree-shaken dynamic imports will no longer create chunks or influence chunking in any way (#2575)
- Dynamic imports will no longer follow the `entryFileNames` but the `chunkFileNames` property reflecting those are solely internally used (#2575)
- If there are chunk naming conflicts, entry chunks will always take precedence (#2575)
- If an entry facade is created, only the facade chunk is marked as `isEntry` (#2575)
- Dynamic chunks will only be marked as `isEntry` if they are actually entry chunks as well; thus there is now a 1-to-1 correspondence between modules listed in `input` and chunks marked as `isEntry` (#2575)
- Chunks no longer contain imports for variables that are tree-shaken in the chunk but used in other chunks (#2584)
- Chunks will always import re-exported variables directly from the chunk where they are originally exported from ( #2584)
- Null characters will be pruned from chunk ids to allow for virtually created chunks and make `rollup-plugin-multi-entry` compatible with code-splitting and thus the upcoming 1.0 version (#2590)
- Simplify the UMD wrapper code as much as possible, especially if there are no exports (#2594)
- The UMD wrapper will now work in strict mode by checking for `self` before `this` when determining the global variable (#2594)

### Bug Fixes

- If a facade is created for a dynamic entry point, this facade will be imported instead of the facaded chunk (#2575)
- Manual chunks that include multiple entry points will have proper facades created for all entry points if necessary ( #2575)
- If missing exports are shimmed, the shim variable will not be global but created on a per-module basis and is deconflicted with variables having the same name (#2584)
- Missing export shims work properly in SystemJS (#2584)
- `preserveModules` now handles dynamic namespace imports (#2584)
- Fix chunk execution order in certain scenarios (#2584)
- Exports and assignments using destructuring syntax will properly update the exported variables when generating SystemJS output (#2587)
- Hashes in chunk names will now also take dynamic imports into account (#2596)

- Update deps

## 0.20.0

- Support for [plugins](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Plugins) ([#207](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pulls/207))
- BREAKING – `options.transform`, `options.load`, `options.resolveId`, `options.resolveExternal` and `options.external` are no longer supported, and should be handled by plugins. [More info](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Plugins)
- BREAKING – the .js extension is only added if it looks like there's no extension, allowing e.g. `import data from 'data.json'` (with the appropriate transformer). For safety, always include the file extension – import `./foo.js`, not `./foo`

## 0.19.2

- Fix exporting namespaces to include all of their exports ([#204](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/204))

- Exposed the version string through the API: `require( 'rollup' ).VERSION`

## 0.19.0

- **breaking** The `transform` option is no longer passed through to custom loaders. Loaders should only concern themselves with providing source code; transformation will _always_ take place
- `options.transform` functions can return a string, or a `{code, map, ast}` object. Where possible, sourcemap chains will be flattened ([#175](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/175))
- `options.resolveId`, `options.resolveExternal` and `options.load` can each be a function or an array of functions. If an array, the first non-null/undefined return value is used. In both cases, failed resolution/loading will fall back to the defaults, unless an error is thrown. ([#174](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/174))
- New `intro` and `outro` options – similar to `banner` and `footer` except inserted _inside_ any format-specific wrapper

## 0.16.3

- Prevent adjacent blocks of multiple var declarations causing magic-string failure ([#105](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/105))

## 0.16.2

- Top-level function calls and assignments to globals are treated as side-effects, and always included

- Fix bug with shadowed variables that are eventually exported ([#91](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/91))
- Exclude unused function declarations that happen to modify a used name ([#90](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/90))
- Simplify internal `Scope` model – scopes always attach to blocks, never function expressions/declarations

## 0.14.1

- `export { name } from './other'` does not create a local binding ([#16](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/16))
- A single binding can be exported under multiple names ([#18](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/18))

## 0.11.3

- Class methods are not incorrectly renamed ([#42](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/42))

- IIFEs are ignored for the purposes of distinguishing between 'strong' and 'weak' dependencies
- Empty `var` declarations for exported bindings are omitted

## 0.9.1

- Much faster statement insertion (fixes major 0.9.0 performance regression)

## 0.9.0

- BREAKING - `resolvePath` is now `resolveId`. The returned `id` (which by default is a filepath) is passed to the `load` function, which can optionally be overridden, and which is applied to all modules including the entry module. This allows custom resolver and loading logic for integration with third party systems (e.g. JSPM) or, eventually, in-browser usage ([#30](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/30))
- A statement cannot appear after later statements from the same bundle ([#34](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/34))

## 0.8.2

- Support `moduleId` and `moduleName` via CLI ([#24](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/24))

## 0.8.1

- Anonymous functions that are exported as default are converted to named function declarations for correct hoisting, rather than being bound to functions ([#29](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/29))
- Automatically-generated default export names are deconflicted with local definitions ([#29](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/29))

## 0.8.0

- Top-level variable declarations with multiple declarators are split up, to avoid unnecessary code importing and incorrectly-ordered statements ([#26](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/26))
- `this` at the top level is `undefined` ([#28](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/28))

## 0.7.8

- Avoid using `path.parse` - unsupported in node 0.10

## 0.7.7

## 0.7.3

- Default exports are not bound. To enable this, statements within a module are sorted to retain their original order ([#15](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/15))
- Better positioning of comments ([#14](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/14))
- Various fixes to get Travis-CI rigged up

## 0.7.2

- Fix sourcemap paths on Windows ([#6](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/6))

## 0.7.1

- Named functions can be used as default exports from a bundle
- Method calls are assumed to mutate the owner (i.e. `foo.bar()` mutates `foo`) ([#13](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/13))
- `options.indent` can be used to control indentation of resulting bundle. `options.true` (default) means ' auto', `options.false` means empty string. Alternatively specify whitespace e.g. `' '` or `'\t'` ([#5](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5))

## 0.7.0

- Ensure statements are always separated by a newline ([#9](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/9))
- Use CommonJS `exports` correctly (UMD exports)
- Throw error if `moduleName` is required but missing (UMD exports)
- Attach IIFE global to `this` rather than `window`
- Allow names inside bundle to the the names of `Object.prototype` properties ([#12](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/12))

## 0.6.1

- Support for basic transformers

## 0.6.0

- BREAKING - `rollup.rollup` and `bundle.write` both take a single options argument
- BREAKING - external modules must be declared upfront with `options.external: [...]`
- Non-relative module paths will be resolved by looking for `jsnext:main` fields in the appropriate `package.json` files. This behaviour can be overridden by passing an alternative `resolveExternal` function
- Fix sourcemap options
- Include CLI files in npm package (duh)

## 0.5.0

- Command line interface
- Sourcemap generation
- Correct behaviour with `export { x as y } from 'z'`

## 0.4.1

- More import name deconflicting

## 0.4.0

- Self-hosting! `rollup.rollup` now rolls up rollup

  while making animal noises.

  Pull Request Requirements:
  * Please include tests to illustrate the problem this PR resolves.
  * Please lint your changes by running `npm run lint` before creating a PR.

List any relevant issue numbers:

<!--
If this PR resolves any issues, list them as

-  resolves #1234

where 1234 is the issue number. This will help us with house-keeping as Github will automatically add a note to those issues stating that a potential fix exists. Once the PR is merged, Github will automatically close those issues.

Starting each line with a dash "-" will cause GitHub to display the issue title inline.

If an issue is only solved partially or is relevant in some other way, just list the number without "resolves".

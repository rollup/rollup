# Rollup

Rollup is a JavaScript module bundler that compiles small pieces of code into larger, more complex applications, using the standardized ES module format. It enables developers to write future-proof code using modern JavaScript features, while delivering optimized output for current browsers and Node.js environments.

## Why Rollup?

Developing software is easier when you break your project into smaller, manageable modules. JavaScript historically lacked robust module support, but with ES6 modules, this became possible. However, not all environments support ES6 modules natively. Rollup allows you to author code using modern modules and then bundles it into formats supported everywhere, such as CommonJS, AMD, and IIFE.

## Features

- **Tree Shaking:** Eliminates unused code for smaller, faster bundles.
- **Multiple Output Formats:** Supports ES modules, CommonJS, AMD, IIFE, and more.
- **Plugin System:** Extend Rollup's behavior with a flexible plugin API.
- **Fast and Reliable:** Optimized for speed and consistent output.
- **Supports Native and WASM:** Offers native builds for each platform and WebAssembly builds for browser and Node.js environments.

## Quick Start

Install Rollup globally:

```sh
npm install -g rollup
```

Or as a project dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev rollup
```

Bundle your project:

```sh
rollup main.js --file bundle.js --format cjs
```

For advanced configuration, create a `rollup.config.js` file.

## Compatibility

Rollup supports modern JavaScript syntax and works in Node.js and browser environments. For browser usage, check out [`@rollup/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/browser). For Node.js, the standard `rollup` package or the `@rollup/wasm-node` package (WebAssembly-based) is available.
